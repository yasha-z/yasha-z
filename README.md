# Hey there, I'm Yasha!

I'm a third-year Computer Science student who’s super curious when it comes to machine learning, web development, computer vision, and augmented reality.

Right now, I’m working on some exciting stuff:

- A **face recognition web app** built using Streamlit and CNNs.
- An **AI-powered RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) project** that combines language models with smart search to provide accurate, context-aware responses.
- **Study Buddy** – a productivity app built with **Flask** that includes:
  - ⏱️ Pomodoro timers & Sessions tracking
  - ✅ To-do lists
  - 😴 **Fatigue detection using computer vision** to alert users when they seem tired or distracted
  - Smart break suggestions
  - Motivational quotes based on task types
- A **customer churn prediction model** that helps businesses figure out when and why users might leave.

## What I’ve Worked With

I love working with:
- **Python**, **Flask**, **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **Streamlit** for backend + AI/ML/CV.
- **React**, **Bootstrap**, **Javascript** and **HTML/CSS** for front-end development.
- **Unity**, **Vuforia**, **ARCore** for fun and functional AR project.

## A Bit More About Me ✨

I teach machine learning at UTech, helping students (locally and internationally).  
What excites me the most is creating things that are actually useful to me and others.
